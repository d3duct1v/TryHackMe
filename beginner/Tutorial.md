# Tutorial
## Task 1: Starting your first machine
On TryHackMe you'll learn by starting and hacking machines
Lets start your AttackBox, a web-based machine used to attack other machines you start on tasks.

1. Click the blue  button at the top of this room; the AttackBox is what you will use to access target machines you start on tasks such as this one.
2. Start the target machine shown on this task and wait 1 minute for it to configure.
3. Copy the IP Address of the machine that you just started on this task, then on the AttackBox (right-hand side), open up Firefox and paste the IP Address into the URL bar.
    The machines you start on tasks (left hand-side) are the "target machines" and are accessed by the AttackBox (right hand-side).

Alternatively you can access machines via OpenVPN

When you've finished with a machine in any room, make sure to stop it by clicking the red "Terminate" button.
___
Follow the steps in this task. What is the flag text shown on the website of the machine you started on this task?
A flag is just a piece of text that's used to verify you've performed a certain action. In security challenges, users are asked to find flags to prove that they've successfully hacked a machine.
