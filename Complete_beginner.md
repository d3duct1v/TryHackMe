# Complete Beginner

The beginner path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas in Computer Security. This path will be looking at the following areas:

* Basic Linux - Get familiar with the linux command line.
* Web Application Security - Learn web application security concepts through the OWASP Top 10
* Network Security - Using essential tools like NMAP to enumerate infrastructure.
* Scripting Challenges - Using Python and Bash to carry out different tasks.
* Privilege Escalation

Once you complete the beginner path, you should have learnt the fundamental knowledge for each specific area, and use these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within the area.

## Complete Beginner Introduction
This section focuses on introducing you to the TryHackMe platform, and to the cyber security industry. Once you understand the virtual room concept on TryHackMe, you'll start exploring the different careers in cyber security to get a better feel of what you may like to do. After which, you'll learn how to effectively research for complex answer - cyber security is a very broad field and understand how to find relevant information will be extremely useful to you.
